		<h1 class="font">SUSPECTED VICTIMS</h1>
		<h3 class="center">People who may or may not have been murdered by the Zodiac.</h3>
		<h2 class="font">The Santa Barbara Attack</h2>
		<h3 class="font">The Zodiac Killer&rsquo;s first assumed attack was in June of 1963.</h3>
		<img class="img" src="robertandlinda.jpg" width="400" alt="Image of Robert Domingos and Linda Edwards.">
		<p class="font">The remains of a man and a woman were found in a shack by the beach. The bodies were of Robert Domingos&sbquo; age 18, and his fiance Linda Edwards&sbquo; age 17. They were found by Robert&rsquo;s father after he went searching for them when they didn&rsquo;t return home the night before. The victims were bound with rope and shot to death with Robert being shot 11 times and Linda being shot nine times. The day they were murdered the couple participated in the school&rsquo;s annual &ldquo;Senior Ditch Day&rdquo; and decided to go to the beach and sunbathe. It is believed that the killer approached them as they were sunbathing and held them at gunpoint. He forced Edwards to bound Domingos with some rope he provided. As Edwards was doing this&sbquo; they both attempted to flee but were shot multiple times with a .22&ndash;caliber weapon which killed them. From there&sbquo; the killer dragged their bodies to the shack in which they were found in and tried to set it on fire using matches but failed to do so. It is assumed that this murder was done by the Zodiac Killer as the murderer in this case had used the same ammunition and had many similarities as the Zodiac Killer in a case five years later&sbquo; the Lake Herman Murders. This case was only suggested to be the work of the Zodiac Killer in 1972&sbquo; nine years after the murder. This was the only case out of all four suspected cases that actually seemed to be done by the Zodiac Killer.</p>
		<h2 class="font">Cheri Josephine Bates</h2>
		<img class="img" src="cjb.jpg" width="250" alt="Image of Cheri Josephine Bates.">
		<h3 class="font">On October 30, 1966&sbquo; the murder of 18 year&ndash;old Cheri Josephine Bates took place.</h3>
		<p class="font">Bates had left a note for her father that morning saying she&rsquo;d be going to the library and that much was true but the next day held results no parent would ever want to hear. In an alleyway&sbquo; Bates was found lying dead on the floor. She was beaten and stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed. Her car was found abandoned in the library parking lot and it is believed that it had been tampered with while she was in the library. At the crime scene they found a men&rsquo;s Timex watch&sbquo; a footprint and that Bates had some hairs covered in dried blood in her hand. After this murder&sbquo; the local police and newspaper departments received a letter called &ldquo;The Confession&rdquo;. The author of the letter claimed to be the killer himself and provided some details of the crime scene that weren&rsquo;t revealed but it is believed to be written by a hoaxster. The Zodiac Killer wrote a letter in 1971 to a different newspaper department claiming responsibility of the Bates case. The Bates case also contained many similarities to the Zodiac&rsquo;s Lake Berryessa Lake Attack and police&ndash;taunting letters. In December 1966&sbquo; a gruesome poem was found scratched onto one of the desks in the victim&rsquo;s college. The poem found on the desk and the letters sent to the police and newspaper department were found to be the work of the Zodiac Killer but the local police department strongly believe that he is not the murderer in this case. However&sbquo; the police department does believe he has some sort of involvement or ties in this case. </p>
		<h2 class="font">The Modesto Attack</h2>
		<img class="img" src="kathleen.jpg" width="200" alt="Image of Kathleen Johns.">
		<h3 class="font">On March 22nd of 1970&sbquo; a pregnant woman named Kathleen Johns claimed to have been kidnapped by the Zodiac Killer.</h3>
		<p class="font">Kathleen was seven months pregnant and had her 10 month old daughter with her at the time. She was driving to Petaluma&sbquo; Calif to visit a sick relative when a man signaled to her that something was wrong with one of the tires to her car. She pulled over and so did the man. He offered to fix the wheel but once he &ldquo;finished&rdquo;&sbquo; he only seemed to make it worse. When she started to get back onto the highway&sbquo; her tire just fell off. The man offered to help once again by taking her to a nearby gas station but when she got into his car, things took a turn for the worse. She claimed that he drove them around the backroads near a town named Tracy for two hours and threatened their lives the whole trip. She was able to jump out the car with her daughter and a driver passing by drove her to a nearby police station where she was able to identify her kidnapper as the Zodiac Killer from a wanted poster on the wall. When police investigated this case&sbquo; they found Johns&rsquo; car two miles from where it was originally left and burned. Months after this report&sbquo; the Zodiac mailed a letter to a newspaper department talking about a &ldquo;rather interesting ride&rdquo; he had with a woman and a baby but he did not provide any details that would solidly link him to the act.</p>
		<h2 class="font">The Lake Tahoe Disappearance</h2>
		<img class="img" src="donnalass.jpg" width="200" alt="Image of Donna Lass.">
		<h3 class="font">On September 6th&sbquo; 1970&sbquo; a woman named Donna Lass disappeared.</h3>
		<p class="font">Donna Lass worked as a nurse in a hospital in San Francisco. Her last logbook entry at the hospital was at about 1:50 A.M. and her car was found abandoned in her apartment parking lot. Apparently&sbquo; Donna&rsquo;s employer and landlord had received a call from an unidentified man stating that Donna had to leave town due to family emergencies yet her family said there was no such emergency. This call has since been claimed as a hoax. It is suspected that she was killed the night she was abducted and that she was abducted after she arrived at her apartment. If this is true&sbquo; this is not behavior shown by the Zodiac Killer in any of his other cases. Her body has still not been found until this day. There are no connections to the Zodiac Killer in this case other than a postcard that was supposedly from him. This postcard was mailed to a newspaper department in the March of 1971. The card was an advertisement that featured in three different newspapers the week before. It advertised an area that was in development and it was believed by many to be the burial site of Donna Lass but there are many people that believe that this postcard was forged since information on this card conflicted information in other letters the Zodiac had sent. </p>
