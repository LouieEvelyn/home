		<h2 class="center">An unidentified murderer from the 1960s.</h2>
		<h3 class="center">The Zodiac Killer was a notorious murderer in California. He has claimed the lives of five people and has two failed attempts of murder. Although there is only 7 murders linked to him&sbquo; it is believed that there are actually a total of 37 murders he has committed. The Zodiac Killer is still unidentified to this day despite there being police sketches released of the killer along with witnesses. The Zodiac Killer often sent letters to the police and left ciphered notes behind in the crime scenes. The Zodiac Killer used these letters and notes along with calls to mock and taunt the police. In these notes&sbquo; he wrote horrific messages&sbquo; sometimes left things from the crime scene in the letter or he&rsquo;d tell them about his crimes. In other letters&sbquo; he left blueprints of deadly bombs and maps of certain areas to show his knowledge. He murdered in various ways&sbquo; using knives or guns. His identified victims were all students&sbquo; most of them were in high school and couples. There were 4 other cases that were assumed to be the doing of the Zodiac Killer as police received letters that were apparently from him claiming responsibility for the cases but no solid evidence within these letters showed that he committed these crimes so it is believed by the police departments of those areas that he was not the suspect.</h3>
